Covid-Income Coding Sample

This code was created as part of a research project examining the impact of income on Covid-19 vaccination rates across the United States, with controls for majority political affiliation at the county level. Brief notes and explanations are included in the code. Please note that while I did collaborate with others on this project as a whole, this coding sample is my own. 

If you have any issues running it, please contact me at sophia.ellen.campbell@gmail.com
